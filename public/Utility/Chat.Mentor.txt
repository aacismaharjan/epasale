We need to manage layouts.

There are following methods-
1. Float
2. Flexbox
3. Grid

Among them, we must know float and should know flexbox.

Learn float on your own.
Let's do it with flexbox. 

First, we need to make flex container
Second, we need to display flex items in column

Let's get started.

Conversations
Bujeu? Maile sabai items lai .flex-container ma rakheko?
um

Maile aba items haru lai .flex-item ma rakheko? Bujeu??
um 3 ota items.

We saw ki flex-items haru column vayera display vayeko xa. But we need to display it in column.
So, we need to change flex-direction for .flex-item

Default chai flex-direction: row hunxa.

Aba flex-item ko bhitra img and .description lai chai display flex ani flex-direction: row 
garnu parxa.

Bujirako xau??
xa

Bujeu? K gareko??
umm

Aba flex-shrink and flex-grow ko concept.
Flex-shrink le flex-items lai sano parne ki nai vanera set garna milxa.
If value is 0, then do not make it sano.
If value is 1, then you can make it sano and so on as value increases.

Got it??
yup, minimize jasto ho?
Umm, it about minimize garne ki nai.

Varkharai, flex-item ko style milako by giving white background, adding 8px padding and adding
curve of 4px i.e border radius Got it??
um got it.

Tmle position use gareko product container ra checkout container lai milauna? Why??
height width na milerw

Tyo position ko idea ramro lagyo but tyo ali advance concept ho. Do not recommend. 
Aba layout ko concept use garne yesma pani Okay??

okayy

Tyo vanda agadi let's refactor some code.
We will make .flex-container as .row 
ani we will make .flex-item as .col

Is that alright??
class name>? 
YES
okay

We will add additional change .flex-container as .card-container-summary
Ani, we will add additional change .flex-item as card-product-summary
For giving names to our cards.

Okay??
why
To target them in css, .row will be in every element as needed 
but .card-container-summary will be in one element, that we can target and change it easily
without changing code in .row class. It is for clean code purpose.

okay.

We will remove .flex-container class now, as it is transferred to
.card-container-summary okay??

okay

So far, we have changed names and added additional names.
This process is called refactoring. It is useful as it
way of making our code readable by outside developer for
better collaboration. ,

You got that??
yes
but im hungry. 
Alright, give me 10 more minutes, I will wrap this up. Okay??
not okay, 
Let's do this way, tme mam khau or eat something, I will code in your laptop
Ani I add comments, ani tmro khana sakesi, I will explain. Okay??

okay i see.
Okay babe.

Wait, I'm figuring this out. I'm making you follow system, so it will be easier paxi.
ok

I added .row-horizontal to make it display in flex-direction: column;
So, we can tweak direction with this class

We added row to .card-product-summary because, it is nested flex-container.
I eat aba. You look code, css, and nabujeko note gara.
Okay??
okay. ahile samma ko complex vayo
Umm, it is. But yesari nai use garxam vane sadhai professionally. 
Make yourself comfortable. I will explain khana khaye paxi pani.
okay

Now, let's remove position wala, ani add row class.
